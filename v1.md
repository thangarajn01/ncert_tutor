# NCERT Tutor: Achievements Overview

1. **Data Ingestion & Topic Extraction**
   
*ingest_data.py*:

* Loads all NCERT PDF files from a structured directory.
* Splits each PDF into text chunks with metadata (grade, subject, chapter).
* Prepares documents for vector storage.

*build_topics.py*:

* Walks through your data directory.
* Extracts and saves available topics (chapters) for each grade and subject into a JSON file for UI use.

2. **Vector Store Creation**
   
*build_vector_store.py*:

* Uses OpenAI embeddings to convert all document chunks into vectors.
* Stores them in a FAISS vector store for fast similarity search.
* Saves the vector store locally for later retrieval.
  
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline**
   
*rag_pipeline.py*:

* Loads the FAISS vector store and OpenAI embedding model.
* Sets up a retriever to fetch relevant document chunks based on user queries, filtered by grade and subject.
* Uses a prompt that instructs the LLM to answer only from the retrieved context.
* Returns both the answer and a list of source snippets (with file name, page number, and content).
* Also supports quiz generation using the same RAG approach, returning MCQs based on the selected topic.

4. **Backend API**

*backend.py*:
* FastAPI server with endpoints for:
    * /ask: Accepts a question, grade, and subject, and returns an answer with sources.
    * /quiz: Accepts grade, subject, and topic, and returns a structured quiz.

5. **Streamlit Frontend** 

*ui.py*:
* User interface for:
    * Selecting grade, subject, and topic.
    * Asking questions and viewing answers with cited sources (nested bullet formatting).
    * Generating and taking quizzes, with automatic scoring and feedback.
    * Renders answers with Markdown and MathJax for math support.

6. **End-to-End RAG Workflow**

*It is a full RAG pipeline*:
* Users ask questions or request quizzes.
* The system retrieves relevant NCERT content, passes it to an LLM, and returns grounded, cited answers or quizzes.
* All sources are traceable back to the original PDF content.
  
## Summary
Implemented a robust, end-to-end NCERT Tutor system that ingests textbooks, builds a searchable vector database, retrieves relevant content for user queries, generates answers and quizzes using an LLM, and presents everything in a user-friendly web interface with source citations.
